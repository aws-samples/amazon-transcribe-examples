### Custom Vocabulary blogs

1. [Improve transcription accuracy of customer-agent calls with custom vocabulary](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/improve-transcription-accuracy-of-customer-agent-calls-with-custom-vocabulary-in-amazon-transcribe/)

Post demonstrates how you can provide more information to Amazon Transcribe with custom vocabularies to update the way Amazon Transcribe handles transcription of your audio files with business-specific terminology. We show the steps to improve the accuracy of transcriptions for Hinglish calls (Indian Hindi calls containing Indian English words and phrases). You can use the same process to transcribe audio calls with any language supported by Amazon Transcribe. After you create custom vocabularies, you can transcribe audio calls with accuracy and at scale by using our post call analytics solution, which we discuss more later in this post.

2. [Live transcriptions of F1 races using Amazon Transcribe](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/live-transcriptions-of-f1-races-using-amazon-transcribe/)

This post shows how Formula 1 joined forces with the AWS Professional Services team to make it happen. We discuss how they used Amazon Transcribe and its custom vocabulary feature as well as custom-built postprocessing logic to improve their live transcription accuracy in three languages.

3. [Improving speech-to-text transcripts from Amazon Transcribe using custom vocabularies and Amazon Augmented AI](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/improving-speech-to-text-transcripts-from-amazon-transcribe-using-custom-vocabularies-and-amazon-augmented-ai/)

This post shows how to use Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) to help generate this list of domain-specific terms by sending low-confidence predictions from Amazon Transcribe to humans for review. We measure the word error rate (WER) of transcriptions and number of correctly-transcribed terms to demonstrate how to use custom vocabularies to improve transcription of domain-specific terms in Amazon Transcribe.
